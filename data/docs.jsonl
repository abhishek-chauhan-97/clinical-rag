{"id": "paracetamol_usage_2", "text": "The recommended adult dosage of paracetamol is typically 500 mg to 1000 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. It's crucial not to exceed 4000 mg (4g) in a 24-hour period to prevent liver damage. For children, dosage is based on their weight and should follow a doctor's or pharmacist's advice."}
{"id": "paracetamol_mechanism_1", "text": "The exact mechanism of action for paracetamol is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins in the central nervous system (CNS). Prostaglandins are compounds that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By blocking their production, paracetamol helps to reduce these symptoms."}
{"id": "paracetamol_side_effects_1", "text": "While generally safe at recommended doses, paracetamol can cause side effects. The most serious side effect is liver damage, which can occur from an overdose. Symptoms of liver damage may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and yellowing of the skin or eyes."}
{"id": "paracetamol_warnings_1", "text": "Paracetamol should be used with caution in individuals with pre-existing liver conditions or those who consume alcohol regularly.
